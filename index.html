                    <p> Besides my professional pursuits, I have a penchant for coffee and weight training. I find solace in hiking amidst mountains and delving into books. Horror and thriller movies captivate me, and I cherish exploring new destinations. Coffee shops beckon me, and I revel in leisurely walks with my pets. Additionally, I indulge my creative side through handcrafting intricate macramé knots.
